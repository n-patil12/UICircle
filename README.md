# UICircle ðŸ“š

International students face difficulty with trying to find clubs and connect with other students. Specifically, without any idea of current public forums, new students would have needed to find out  about clubs through mutuals and or Involvement Fair, which only comes around once a semester. UICircle is designed to help students connect to their peers though easily streamlined access to UIC organizations, where events and announcements willbe posted on the public forum
